## nsg

A spork of Angular CLI for NativeScript & Angular projects, run nsg command as ng.

#### Installation

`npm install -g nsg`

#### Usage

Same as `ng` command in Angular CLI, except that nsg generates project/component/services/... comsumed by NativeScript.

#### Samples:

1. Create new project: `nsg new hello`
  
2. Generate a component named item: `nsg generate component item`

Most options in `ng` also available in `nsg`, like `--inline-style`, `--flat` ...

#### Use `tns`

After coding, run `tns run android|ios` to run.

#### Difference between `nsg` and `ng`

* nsg uses nsg-cli.json as the configure filename
* nsg makes absolute templateUrl and styleUrls as NativeScript requires it
* nsg uses NativeScriptModule instead of RouterModule
* nsg tries to make project structure looks like `ng` does as well as `tns` does
* default selectors are prefixed with 'ns' instead of 'app'

#### Project structure made by `nsg`

```
+ hello/
    + .git/
    + app/
        + ns
            - app.module.ts
            - app.component.ts
            - app.component.html
            - app.component.css
        - app.css
        - main.ts
        - package.json
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json
    - nsg-cli.json
    - README.md
    - .gitignore
```

`nsg` replaces **src** folder with **app**, as `tns` does. Since **app** is used, so this folder inside src is changed to **ns**.
